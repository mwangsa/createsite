# Create IIS Website Script


You can use CreateTestFiles.ps1 if you want to create some dummy test files.  Those test files will be created under C:\DemoSite folder by default.

You may want to edit the .json file and adjust the site configuration to suit your environment.

When you run CreateWebsite.ps1, you need to parse in the .json file as parameter.
